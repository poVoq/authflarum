# AuthFlarum

Have MediaWiki authenticate against a Flarum database for user logins.
This requires Wiki users to have accounts on a forum.

We can strip out a lot of things central to other user account plugins
because Flarum takes a bare bones approach to user management. Users and
groups already work pretty much perfectly with MediaWiki.
